PIO (RP2040) implementation of DDCMP framing

Sync clocking: transmit data changes on falling edge of bit clock;
receive data is latched on rising edge.  Choice of local clock source
(DCE mode) or clock input (DTE mode).

Integral modem standard speeds: 56k, 250k, 500k, 1M bps.  For encoding
details see DMC line unit manual.  The framer includes the modem
function implemented in (PIO) software.

USB protocol to host

The framer is a DDCMP device, communication class, emulating an
Ethernet NIC.  The NIC hardware address is hardcoded aa-00-03-04-05-06
(an unused address from a range assigned to DEC and then rendered
obsolete by 802 -- see ether-i.pdf).  The device then appears as
another Ethernet node connected to that NIC, with hardcoded address
aa-00-03-04-05-07.

Communication with the framer uses protocol type is 60-06 (DEC
protocol type assigned to "Customer use").

Payload is either a DDCMP frame, or a command/status packet.  The
encoding is slightly different for inbound (received data to host)
vs. outbound (transmitted data from host).

Outbound payloads are simply DDCMP frames as encoded on the wire,
except that the CRC fields are omitted (so the DDCMP header is only 6
bytes).  The framer supplies header and (if applicable) data CRC
fields, as well as leading SYN and trailing DEL bytes.

Inbound payloads begin with a 2-byte receive status value, followed by
the received DDCMP frame exactly as received, including the CRC
fields.  Note that the framer implements CRC checking; the host
normally would not look at the CRC bytes but simply use the status
value to learn whether the packet is good or bad.

In either direction, we ignore the minimum frame length of Ethernet;
only the needed bytes are sent since the USB emulated Ethernet NIC
does not appear to object to undersized frames.

Command/status packets begin with 0x11 (DC1) which is not a DDCMP
frame start value.  Outbound they carry commands to the adapter;
inbound they carry status and counters.  Note that the inbound status
packet is preceded by a receive status word, as always.

Receive status word values:
0: good frame
1: Header CRC error
2: Data CRC error
3: Frame too long (if so, the entire data field is absent)

Command packets start with 0x11.  The next byte is the command:
0: status request
1: start
2: stop
All commands produce a status packet in reply (the status request
simply is a "no state change" command).

For start, configuration settings follow:
Flag bits (2 bytes):
0: DCE mode (if 0, DTE mode)
1: Integral modem (if 0, RS232)
2: Local clock (if 0, modem supplies clock).  Not applicable for
integral modem
3: Internal loopback.  Implies local clock if not integral modem.

Speed: (4 bytes):
This specifies the bit rate in bits per second.  For RS232, it is the
frequency of the receive and transmit clock signals (if local clock is
specified).  For integral modem, it is the transmit speed and the
nominal receive speed; actual receive clocking is from the incoming
data, which must match the specified rate +/- 6%.  Speed is not
applicable for RS232 modem supplied clock, in which the bit clocking
is entirely under control of the modem.  Note that RS232 is not
officially specified for high speeds; it works well at 56 kbps with
short cables, and can perhaps be made to work at 250 kbps, but it
certainly won't run at 1 Mbps since the required rise/fall times are
too slow for that.  Standard integral modem speeds go as high as 1
Mbps; the adapter can go a lot faster but standard DEC hardware does
not.

Status packet starts with 0x11, followed by state and counter data:

state (1 byte): on = 1, off = 0.
flags (2 bytes): as described above for the Start command
speed (4 bytes): as described above.  Not supplied for RS232 modem
clock case (where the speed is not known).
Counters -- all are 4 bytes and wrap on overflow:
received good frames
transmitted frames
received good bytes
transmitted bytes
header crc errors
data crc errors
frame too long errors
buffer unavailable errors
